_**There's such a thin line between winning and losing.**_

John R. Tunis



_**Plant your own garden and decorate your own soul, instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers.**_

Veronica A. Shoffstall

_**Ideas are these disembodied life forms, they don't have a form, but they have a will. All they want is to be made manifest. If you can manage to open up your consciousness to an idea of living in a world of abundance, then you can believe that, constantly, ideas are trying to find human collaborators.**_

Elizabeth Gilbert

_**Great ambition is the passion of a great character. Those endowed with it may perform very good or very bad acts. All depends on the principals which direct them.**_

Napoleon Bonaparte

_**Don't be tempted to break momentum-work through it.**_

Lorii Myers

_**Your fears, your critics, your heroes, your villains: They are fictions you perceive as reality. Choose to see through them. Choose to let them go.**_

Isaac Lidsky

_**Own 100 percent of your focus. The most challenging of endurance drills will bring you to a level of optimal mental and physical performance.**_

Lorii Myers

_**Persistence is very important. You should not give up unless you are forced to give up.**_

Elon Musk

_**If you want to make your dreams come true, the first thing you have to do is wake up.**_

J.M. Power

_**Keep a positive mind. Remember, a failed attempt doesn't make you a failure-giving up does.**_

Lorii Myers

_**It is easy to sit up and take notice, What is difficult is getting up and taking action.**_

Honore de Balzac
